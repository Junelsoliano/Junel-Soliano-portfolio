                 𝓶𝓸𝓽𝓽𝓸 : “𝘿𝙤 not be 𝙖𝙛𝙧𝙖𝙞𝙙”. that is 𝙢𝙮 favorite 𝙢𝙤𝙩𝙩𝙤 to live by because everyday, everyone faces 𝙨𝙤𝙢𝙚 sort of fear. This short phrase 𝙧𝙚𝙢𝙞𝙣𝙙𝙨 𝙢𝙚 to stay brave and focus on the good in 𝙢𝙮 life and sorrounded 𝙢𝙚. In 𝙢𝙮 life, 𝙢𝙮 greatest love is 𝙢𝙮 𝙛𝙖𝙢𝙞𝙡𝙮 and friends. These 2 things keep 𝙢𝙚 happy in life and they are all I need to get through anything in 𝙢𝙮 life and help 𝙢𝙚 follow 𝙢𝙮 𝙢𝙤𝙩𝙩𝙤.
